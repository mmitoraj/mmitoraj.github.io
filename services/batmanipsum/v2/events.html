<p>&lt;%- @partial(&quot;batmanipsum_raml&quot;) %&gt;</p><h3>Death does not wait for you to be ready!</h3><p>Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You&#39;re skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear?</p><h4>Search him. Then I will kill you.</h4><p>But no ordinary child, a child born in hell, forged from suffering, hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege.</p><h5>Peace has cost you your strength.</h5>Victory has defeated you. You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength.<h5>It&#39;s not just your name, sir.</h5>It&#39;s your father&#39;s name. And it&#39;s all that&#39;s left of him. Don&#39;t destroy it.<h5>There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world.</h5>A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes, the pit sends something back.<h3>I&#39;m Batman</h3><h4>Just you, sir?</h4>Don&#39;t worry, Master Wayne. It takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.<h5>You see, I&#39;m a guy of simple taste.</h5>I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline. How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible, without the most powerful impulse of the spirit? The fear of death.<h4>You can swapnot sleeping in a penthouse... for not sleeping in a mansion.</h4>Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.<h5>The first time I stole so that I wouldn&#39;t starve, yes.</h5>I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.<h4>I told you I was immortal.</h4><h5>Oh there are many forms of immortality.</h5>
