<p>We have powerful friends. You&#39;re gonna regret this... I&#39;m sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can&#39;t bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can&#39;t see, pal. What&#39;s goin&#39; on? Luke? Luke&#39;s crazy. He can&#39;t even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I&#39;m out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I&#39;m all right, pal. I&#39;m all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke&#39;s come to rescue me.</p><p>Oh, I told you it was dangerous here. Shall we try and go around? It&#39;ll take time. This whole party&#39;ll be for nothing if they see us. Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here. Quietly, there might be more of them out there. Hey... it&#39;s me. Go for help! Go! Great. Come on. Over there! Two more of them! I see them. Wait, Leia! Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch! Hey, wait! Ahhh! Move closer! Get alongside that one! Get him! Keep on that one! I&#39;ll take these two!</p><p>The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. The Emperor&#39;s coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.</p><p>Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. What&#39;s going on? I don&#39;t know. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thank you. Okay. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back. And hurry up, will ya? I haven&#39;t got all day.</p><p>Search your feelings, father. You can&#39;t do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead.</p>
