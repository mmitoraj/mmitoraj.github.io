I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I&#39;m trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she&#39;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#39;t know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!</p><p>He is here... Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don&#39;t underestimate the power of the Force. The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that&#39;s left of their religion. Yes. Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three. The princess! Put all sections on alert!</p><p>There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. What? You&#39;re far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don&#39;t worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. No! Commence primary ignition.</p><p>What is it? I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She&#39;s here. Well, who...who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She&#39;s here? Princess? What&#39;s going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I&#39;m afraid she&#39;s scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We&#39;ve got to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She&#39;s the one in the message.. We&#39;ve got to help her. Now, look, don&#39;t get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn&#39;t know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?</p><p>I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! We&#39;re coming up on the sentry ships. Hold &#39;em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s gone. There wasn&#39;t anything you could have done. Come on, buddy, we&#39;re not out of this yet! You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!</p>
