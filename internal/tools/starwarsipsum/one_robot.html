I see, sir. Uh, you can call me Luke. I see, sir Luke. Just Luke. And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo. Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action. With all we&#39;ve been through, sometimes I&#39;m amazed we&#39;re in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all. You know of the Rebellion against the Empire? That&#39;s how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.</p><p>Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes. This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.</p><p>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You&#39;re my only hope. What&#39;s this? What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that? Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You&#39;re my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You&#39;re my only hope. Oh, he says it&#39;s nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She&#39;s beautiful. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not quite sure, sir. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... Is there more to this recording? Behave yourself, Artoo. You&#39;re going to get us in trouble. It&#39;s all right, you can trust him. He&#39;s our new master.</p><p>Are they away? They have just made the jump into hyperspace. You&#39;re sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I&#39;m taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.</p><p>Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Get to the top! I can&#39;t Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? They aren&#39;t here! Something must have happened to them. See if they&#39;ve been captured. Hurry! One thing&#39;s for sure. We&#39;re all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it! I&#39;m trying! Thank goodness, they haven&#39;t found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We&#39;ve had some problems... Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They&#39;re dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn&#39;t fast enough. It&#39;s all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we&#39;re all right! We&#39;re all right. You did great.</p>
